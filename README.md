# WineQuality_Clustering
This project addresses the question "How can a winery (or distributor) group wines with similar chemical profiles so it can manage quality, pricing, and production more intelligently — even when human quality labels aren’t available".  
Applying unsupervised learning to group wines by their chemical properties.The goal is to discover natural groupings of wines based on their physicochemical properties without relying on an explicit quality label. The work follows industry‑standard data science practices: exploratory analysis, data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, tuning, evaluation and interpretation.
